Segmentation of an aneurysm of the abdominal Aorta



\section{Task}

The task was to segment the Aorta wall around an aneurysm of the abdominal
aorta using an algorithm implemented in Matlab. 

Here we will briefly describe our initial approaches, give a detailed
description of our final implementation and suggest improvements to our
algorithms.

\section{Approach}

The first idea was to use a simple threshold to segment the bright parts of the
contrast-enhanced aorta. While the inner part of the aorta shows high contrast,
the outer part of the aorta does not, making this approach valuable for finding
contrast-enhanced arteries but not the aneurysm itsself.

Due to the high contrast of the aortic blood finding the egde of the aorta
should be relatively easy
