\section*{Task}

The task was to segment the Aorta wall around an aneurysm of the abdominal
aorta using an algorithm implemented in Matlab. 

This document will briefly describe our initial approaches, give a detailed
description of our final implementation and suggest improvements to our
algorithms.

\section*{Approach}

The first idea was to use a simple threshold to segment the bright parts of the
contrast-enhanced aorta. While the inner part of the aorta shows high contrast,
the outer part of the aorta does not, making this approach valuable for finding
contrast-enhanced arteries but not the aneurysm itsself.

Due to the high contrast of the aortic blood finding the egde of the aorta
using classic edge-detection algorithms should have been relatively easy. 
However the wall of the aorta prooved to be too similar to the surrounding 
tissue and changing parameters of the algorithm only resulted in either too
many or to few detected edges.

Due to the mostly very regular and circular shape of the aorta we quickly 
considered using a knowledge-based approach to edge-detection. The idea was to
use a Hough Transform to detect circular shapes within a certain range of
diameters. Given a slice with high contrast along the aorta wall, a manually
defined region of interest containing the aorta and the correct range of radii
this approach did indeed find the aorta wall quite robustly. Extrapolating from
strong matches from one sclice to the next would probably allow for reasonable
results. However, the necessety for manual interaction, as well as the quite
haphazard assumption of a circular aorta led us to disregard this approach.

The most promising approach, and the one we chose for our final solution, was
to (manually) define a region within the aorta and use a region growing
algorithm to match the actual border of the aneurysm. Due to the very
inconsistent gradient of the edge aorta wall we quickly decided to use the a
level set evolution algorithm, even though the standard implementations didn't
produce desireable results. 

\section*{Solution}

After some research we came upon the Distance Regularized Level Set Evolution
(DRLSE) algorithm by Chunming Li~\cite{Li_TIP08}.

Thresholding
Erosion
DRLSE
Contour erosion
second DRLSE

\section*{Suggestions for further work}

\section*{Appendix: Structure of implementation}

The Matlab implementation of our segmentation algorithm can be found on github
at \url{https://github.com/procrastonos/aortic-aneurysm}.

While the GUI is implemented within the \texttt{aneurysm.m} file, all functions
implementations lay in their own 'm' files within the \emph{private}-folder.
The titles of the files should be self-explanatory. The functions of interest
are \texttt{process.m}, \texttt{levelset.m} and \texttt{circle.m}, which in
turn contain the final algorithm, the DRLSE and the circle matching via
Hough-Transform.
